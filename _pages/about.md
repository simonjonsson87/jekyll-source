My name is Simon Jonsson, and I currently work as a Software Tester in Southampton, UK.

My love for technology has been a constant thread throughout my life, guiding me even when my main occupations have taken me far from the keyboard. Since my early teens, when I began programming and had a summer job as a programmer, I've been fascinated by solving problems through code.

My academic journey has been as varied as my professional one, ranging from Psychology to Statistics and culminating in a PhD in Web Science from the University of Southampton. During my studies, I had the opportunity to combine my technical skills with a deep interest in human-computer interaction, resulting in the creation of Lengua Spanish, a language-learning app developed in native Android Java.

Beyond the realm of technology, I've been fortunate enough to explore a wide range of occupations and experiences. Whether working on a fishing boat in Norway, teaching English in China, or sailing to the Caribbean, I have always sought out opportunities to learn and grow. These experiences, much like my eclectic academic pursuits, reflect my curiosity and belief in the value of embracing new challenges.

With the emergence of DeFi and the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the potential of blockchain technology. While this is a newer interest for me, it feels like a natural extension of my ongoing exploration.
